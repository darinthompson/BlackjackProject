### Overview
This is my rendition of the classic BlackJack game with basic rules. I didn't incorporate advanced play rules of the game as the focus was
more on creating good class structure and abstraction and encapsulation rather than game mechanics of BlackJack.

### Technologies Used

### Lessons Learned
- The thing I struggled with before is over engineering. I had built this program before in C# for school and It was simple because I was learning programming
and OOP for the first time. And I really struggled with it. Making it again, I had a little more confidence and wanted to try new things that in the end 
making things a mess of my code. I had good intention to try and push myself but I ended up just learning that the most 'elaborate' code isn't always the best
code. Keep It Simple Stupid.
- The other thing I really got more familiar with were Enums. I have known what they are and a little of what they do, but I avoided them because I wasn't the most
comfortable with them. Rewriting BlackJack and forcing myself to use Enums over another method was good to grow and expand my knowledge of programming.
